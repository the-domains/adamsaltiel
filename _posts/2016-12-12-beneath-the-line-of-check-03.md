# **Beneath the line of Check 03**

## **The Bad Page**

<div\>Check 03</div\>

But this is rapidly becoming the **Bad Page** again. See below.

---

I had to delete **the Bad Page **as it was mainly dead. A strange case of semi-consciousness possessed it, in an eerie way.  
Most text would not save.  
Except for text in the inserted HTML.

But pictures would upload and position, without warning.  
Also it would unpublish, and republish, but without any of the changes apart from those mentioned.

A half life, no really less than a half life.

But, seriously, how can anyone do web development like this?

The experiment proceeds. More latter.

OK.

So,

1. Changes do not appear immediately, they appear after an unpredictably long period whether or not CDN caching is enabled.
  1. This is not helpful.
  2. There are too many unpredictable oddities. I can increase the indent of an ordered list with a sub-list. OK. But reverse out?
  3. This is too trivial to really be worrying about.
    1. With a bit of messing about this can be navigated, so saves a bit of coding?
2. OK repeat return. So a tip, heaven help us!
3. Back to business.
  1. What is the purpose of this website builder?
  2. There should be means to override the automated processes, any developer would want to be able to do that.
  3. But I can't really find how to.
4. Let me ask and see what I get by way of reply.I should add that any serious developer would put this site builder through its paces before using it, making the sorts of tests I'm making, although with greater rigour.

What is the difference between "on it's own page" and "MAKE FULL POST", which I notice is not reversible?

I guess "MAKE FULL POST" means that everything on this page will appear as one post, wherever it is positioned?

Copy to new post and formatting is retained. That's something.

Saving to "on its own page" not as a full post.

There are so many things (are they features?) that I don't understand.

If you create a new web site the first page is the first added content.

If it flows over to "it's own page" the whole page is linked at the bottom (the whole post).

However, it seems that if a new page is created that is set to appear on the homepage and it's own page, that content appears above the first content (it is a later post).

But I'm not building a blog. So what to do.

Now, if I disable the setting to publish to the home page, it nevertheless remains there.

OK, so what if I redesign? It seems odd to have to redesign when there are issues of order. But I can achieve nothing by reordering the pages in the published view. Actually the new order does not save. Is this a bug or intentional, as so often with theGrid it is difficult to tell?

Let's try to save --- no holding of breath please.

No notification of having saved and then published, why not.

A **Bad, Bad Page.**

But it is working:-

When I say working I can only record what happens.

1. No sign of saving ... saved ... published notifications from the editor.
2. On losing the editor there is the "We are updating your website" notification.
3. The order I have imposed of first post first now remains, so this is the second page and second piece of content on the homepage.
4. I put in an horizontal rule but it is unclear if this is a signal to make the appearance of this page on the home page sparse, content is broken off just below it and that little arrow pops up again that links to this on it's own page.
5. So, question, how easy to move between only home page both homepage and own page, own page only and back again? Do I care at the moment?
  1. If I were doing a thorough investigation I think I would.

Moving on.

It's from w3schools and indicates the slow and painful path of development for me?

Inline styles **are** honoured so why not just work with that?

Now, someone, somewhere doesn't update. Does that mean that this page is or is not saving? It is so difficult to know.

I now have the saved and published notifications again. But my web page is definitely not updated, e.g. with this text.
